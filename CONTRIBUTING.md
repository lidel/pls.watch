# Tests

Make sure your changes follow code style and pass basic suite of regression tests.

To install all dependencies into local directory named `node_modules` and run test suite (`grunt test`), simply execute (Node 0.10):


```bash
npm install && npm test

```

By default tests (including GUI ones) run in headless mode under [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/).
Local HTTP server is spawned automatically for the lifetime of test suite task.

To start simple HTTP server manually (eg. to run tests under Chrome or Firefox instead of PhantomJS):
(`yt.127.0.0.1.xip.io` should point to `127.0.0.1`)

- `npm run httpd`

To run test suite under a specific browser:

- `npm run grunt firefox`
- `npm run grunt chrome`


To check code style:

- `npm run eslint`
